        A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent, and are all related to a single topic. <br>
        Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs. <br>
        This is because paragraphs show a reader where the subdivisions of an essay begin and end, and thus help the reader see the organization of the essay and grasp its main points.<br>

        Paragraphs can contain many different kinds of information. <br>
        A paragraph could contain a series of brief examples or a single long illustration of a general point. <br>
        It might describe a place, character, or process; narrate a series of events; compare or contrast two or more things; classify items into categories; or describe causes and effects.<br>
        Regardless of the kind of information they contain, all paragraphs share certain characteristics. One of the most important of these is a topic sentence.<br>
